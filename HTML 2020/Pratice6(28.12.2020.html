 Difference Between Radio wave and Microwave
radio wave vs microwaveThe radio waves and microwaves are the kinds of electromagnetic waves. Now before understanding the two in detail, we must know its background details such as what are electromagnetic waves and how these can be produced. The electromagnetic waves radiated by accelerating charges. The electric and magnetic fields oscillate simultaneously which result in regeneration of both of the fields. In simple words, the oscillating electric and magnetic fields reproduce each other and the wave is propagated in the space. </p>
